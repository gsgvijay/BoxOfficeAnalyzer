"Epic Ancient Disasters That Would Make Way Cooler Movies Than Pompeii smo.sh/1m6Cz1Y YOU KNOW NOTHING (ABOUT VOLCANOES), JON SNOW!"
Kit Harington stars in our exclusive (and explosive) quad poster for Pompeii
This whole time I've been thinking Pompeii was called Pompe 2.
"If nobody has called POMPEII ""Jon Snow vs the Volcano"" yet I'm claiming that one."

The new Pompeii movie is narrated by an old man who is talking to the spirit of a baby who is trying to decide whether to be born or not
POMPEII: Not since DANTE'S PEAK has there been a film that will have you rooting for the volcano to win.
"Lindsay dropped this mental image on me: Bastille performing ""Pompeii"" with The Muppets"
"At the peak of the Vesuvius eruption, Pompeii temperatures reached around 550° F, also the temp inside a pizza oven."
There's a solid group of people who think POMPEII is the sequel to POMPE.
"Honestly, it might be great. I'm just having trouble imagining a conversation like ""Wanna see Pompeii tonight?"" actually happening."
"""Pompeii will blow your mind."" LOL"
Volcano Movie 'Pompeii' About to Blow at the Box Office bit.ly/1crBejy
i wanna go see Pompeii
"“Never since Titanic has history so perfectly met romance: POMPEII.” — gym tv so that’s why i’m trying to catapult myself to mars, officer"
Emily Browning on the misery of shooting 'Pompeii' 
"Unlikely as it may seem, if there is a sequel to POMPEII, it should be called POMPEIIII. Or perhaps POMPEIV."
Somehow I'd be less apathetic about Pompeii if it was about a volcano that could walk and talk.
I can't tell which one looks worse: Pompeii or 300.
I'm seeing Pompeii. Don't care if I have to go by myself
"Weirdly, at the end of POMPEII it turns out the Umbrella Corporation was responsible."
"But if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all? Pompeii | Bastille"
"I heard POMPEII is a bit underwhelming, so it might only be #8 on Tarantino's Top 10 of 2014."
"So the director of that Pompeii movie is ""Paul W. S. Anderson."" Guess ""Paul Thomas Anderson"" & ""Wes Anderson"" weren't confused often enough"
IM SO ANGRY THEIR SONG IS SO ANNOYING POMPEII IS TEH BESTEST EVER IM GONA ANGRILY EAT MY PIZZA NOW
What's sad is that the knock-off companies couldn't think of doing a Pompeii movie before a studio approved it
The movie 'Pompeii' is like the club you go to after you're denied entry to '300: Rise Of The Empire'.
Can't believe the couple in POMPEII turns out to be the bodies from VOYAGE TO ITALY.
Why does everyone in the movie Pompeii have a British accent?
Pompeii movie look trash
The Milan San Marino Classicisimo is no longer going Up Pompeii!! Good news for Mark Cavendish CBE because he has a phobia about volcanos!!
Waiting All Night and Pompeii sung together is amaaaaazing ??
I think the Pompeii movie commercials would be better if they were set to Pompeii by Bastille.
I actually love the song Pompeii lmao

"I'd see POMPEII, but I haven't seen POMPE, so I'm sure the sequel would simply confuse me."
Is pompeii about a bunch of idiots trying to fight a volcano?
"""Pompeii: Starring Jon Snow, Mr. Eko, and Jack Bauer"" looks like a fantastic hot mess of a movie."
POMPEII? WHEN DID THEY EVEN RELEASE THE FIRST POMPE?
"If Pompeii does good at the box office, will the sequel be called Pompeiii?"
Pompeii better not be wack.
I hope there's a scene in Pompeii when the lead couple leans over the volcano and scream IT'S ALL GREEK TO MEEEEEE
“I hope I don’t PomPEII for living here!” *laughs. lava flows into open mouth.
Pompeii is gonna be so good I can't wait to see it
This Pompeii movie looks good. Don't tell me how it ends
I am seeing Pompeii for two reasons. #1: It looks awesome. #2: Kit Harington's abs. @PompeiiMovie
"I have to believe that everybody who goes to see ""Pompeii"" is just gonna pretend it's a Jon Snow movie."
"Just saw a movie about Pompeii is coming out soon. To be historically accurate, that would have to be a 3 second movie."
Finally someone had the balls to make a movie about Pompeii.
"Between the Jon Snow movie and that song by British Imagine Dragons, Pompeii is having a great year for a city destroyed two millennia ago."
Is POMPEII a new movie or are they just sneaking HERCULES out again and thinking no one will notice?
"Oh, a new movie about Pompeii? Spoiler Alert: Everyone Dies."
Pompeii's Volcano Plan was better than Atlanta's Snow Plan.
"I'm guessing the elevator pitch for ""Pompeii"" was ""300 Titanics."""
I remember being at the theaters watching the trailer to POMPEII and after a girl behind me said she doesn't remember the first Pompe... >:(
"""The floor is lava!"" – everyone, Pompeii, 79 A.D."
I'm beginning to think this Pompeii movie isn't based on that many actual events.
"I SAW THE POMPEII TRAILER! It reminded me of what @mangiotto once said about Titanic: ""Thousands dead; teen angst survives."""
"no disrespect to Paul W.S. Anderson, but Pompeii was also in 3D the first time. "
