EDGE OF TOMORROW is really terrific. Best summer movie this year
"The film ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a summer thriller built to stimulate the senses, not the mind"
Early reviews are confirming my prediction: Edge of Tomorrow will be one of the best popcorn films of summer.
"EDGE OF TOMORROW is so much fun. It's smart, funny, fast paced. It's my favorite film of the summer so far. "
"Man, EDGE OF TOMORROW is great. Rides the 3rd rail of absurd/believable that all great sci-fi does. Cruise is in top form. Solid A."
"Tom Cruise's new ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a fun and funny mashup of ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Aliens"""
I'm sure I'll be on the edge of my seat tomorrow when I watch Edge of Tomorrow.
EDGE OF TOMORROW was one of the best films I've seen this year! Can't recommend it highly enough.
If Edge of Tomorrow starred Ed Norton I'd be there the first day. But fuckin Tom Cruise man.......................
Edge of Tomorrow is 12 kinds of awesome. Finally a live action summer blockbuster that completely delivers.
"Edge of Tomorrow is fantastic, smart and surprisingly hilarious. Tom Cruise plays a soldier with the charisma of movie star Tom Cruise."
"Tom Cruise's 'Edge of Tomorrow' is an alien-war 'Groundhog Day,' and it's pretty great"
"Tapi yang “megang” banget di Edge of Tomorrow justru Emily Blunt. Boy, she’s a total badass!"
"Just saw a screening for the new Cruise movie ""Edge of Tomorrow"". REALLY liked it! Keeps your interest thru out."
"EDGE OF TOMORROW is fantastic. Funny, action-packed, Cruise and Blunt are terrific. A perfect summer movie."
Seated for Edge of Tomorrow screening and so excited. Find it crazy anyone would think Cruise's filmography anything but stellar.
"Everytime that chick in the ""Edge of Tomorrow"" trailer says ""come find me when you wake up"", I assume it's directed at the audience."
"EDGE OF TOMORROW, whatever its faults, is a rare reminder of the surprises & freedoms that franchise culture snuffs out of our blockbusters."
"Okay, so, Edge of Tomorrow sure was the Hollywood version of All You Need Is Kill. This is as positive and as negative as it sounds"
"Edge of Tomorrow: based on a Japanese novel, written by a Japanese author. Number of Japanese cast members, according to IMDb: one."
EDGE OF TOMORROW: aka the unbearable lightness of being tom cruise. like Nietzsche playing Gears of War. remarkably fun until the final boss
"Edge of Tomorrow - Time loop sci-fi action excellence, delivers in full. Cruise is solid, but Emily Blunt - she is THE badass of the summer."
Just watched Edge of Tomorrow! A bloody brilliant filmt. Loved it... A great science fiction film... go see it NOW!
EDGE OF TOMORROW is about as perfect a Summer movie as can be made to live through again & again & again... Incredibly awesome!
EDGE OF TOMORROW is really terrific. Best summer movie this year

"Holy Shit, You Guys Are Really Going To Like Edge of Tomorrow"
Just saw the best movie of this year. Edge of Tomorrow
"EDGE OF TOMORROW is *way* better than I expected. Awesome mix of action, humor, and fun. @TomCruise& Emily Blunt are fantastic together."
"Emily Blunt. Boy, she’s a total badass!"
"What's sticking with me about EDGE OF TOMORROW: the sense of humor, how badass Emily Blunt is."
"So ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is just ""Groundhog Day"" but with guns?"
Name the last hit Tom Cruise had that wasn't associated with Mission Impossible? Edge of Tomorrow just looks horrible
The Edge of Tomorrow is guaranteed to suck.
"Are we ""psyched for"" or ""don't care"" about Edge of Tomorrow? Because I think it looks pretty bad-ass."
Emily Blunt in tears over Edge of Tomorrow body armour
Edge of Tomorrow is a roguelike.
"Just saw the trailer for Edge of Tomorrow. So it's just the exact same plot as Groundhog Day, but with Tom Cruise and future guns?"
Hearing EDGE OF TOMORROW is a great film.
"If I somehow find myself in a theater showing ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" I'm praying Emily Blunt shows up to kill me. AK"
"Whenever I see an Edge of Tomorrow commercial, I think ""poor Tom Cruise""..."
These Edge of Tomorrow posters look like the movie posters made up in Seinfeld and 30 Rock.
apparently the plot of Edge of Tomorrow is that Tom Cruise dies over and over?? what if his part was played by Sean Bean instead
e of tomorrow? Bitch please Edge of Desire is better
Edge of Tomorrow looks like the edge of wuss cliff.
"Ummmm, Edge of Tomorrow looks AWESOME"
"Tom Cruise IS the edge of tomorrow ON the edge of tomorrow DURING the edge of tomorrow IN ""The Edge of Tomorrow."
"EDGE OF TOMORROW: because ""action packed Groundhog's Day"" wasn't exciting enough."
Tom Cruise's EDGE OF TOMORROW is still ALL YOU NEED IS KILL (much more badass!)
This Edge of Tomorrow movie is going to piss me off with the repeat gimmick. I can already tell.
Edge of tomorrow is groundhogs day meets starship troopers. I can handle that
"That Tom Cruise movie, Edge of Tomorrow, would be funny if the entire movie turned out to be a video game from the perspective of the game."
"In related news, Edge of Tomorrow looks like my most anticipated movie of the summer"
"So it looks like they are going all Elysium, Edge of Tomorrow type look"
I'll give EDGE OF TOMORROW one thing: it looks better than TRANSCENDENCE.
i'm bummed because the premise of edge of tomorrow is amazing but i really don't want to see anything with tom cruise in
Edge of tomorrow look like oblivion part 2.....yawn
The Edge of Tomorrow is such a brilliant title I can never remember the movie exists at all. (All You Need is Kill was genius.)
just saw 20 minutes of tom cruise's edge of tomorrow. looks slick. tom cruise is great as always
Edge of Tomorrow looks like pure flames.
'Edge of Tomorrow' - I'm not sure if I'm excited about this movie or not...
"they played the trailer for edge of tomorrow in the cinemas and i got angry (and sad, damn fuck tom fucking cruise)"
Summer films are packed tighter than ever! I fear that an underperforming casualty will be Tom Cruise'd Edge of Tomorrow. Hope I'm wrong.
Actually quite excited by Edge of Tomorrow. Great concept. Only hope Cruise doesn't balls it up
oh damn that Edge of Tomorrow preview was intense
I cannot wait for Edge of Tomorrow. I am thrilled it’s coming out June 6th now. I thought it as nov release. Can’t wait!!
I wish edge of tomorrow was an actual show! I'd so watch it
