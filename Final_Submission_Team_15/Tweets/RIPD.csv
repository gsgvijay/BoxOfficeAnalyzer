RIPD = MIB on LSD?!? #movienews
We take you to the set of Ryan Reynolds new film RIPD tonight!
It's cute that the producers of RIPD are probably watching Sharknado right now and thinking they've done something fundamentally different.
It was between this and RIPD. And I just don't know anymore. - Ryan Reynolds watching Sharknado
RIPD is gonna change the world
"The #RIPD is heading to #SDCC. For updates and exclusives giveaways, text RIPD to 834567. @TheJeffBridges hat from the film could be yours!"
RIPD looks worse than Sharknado
"#UTT Late Edition: Hunger Games, GoT, Exclusives, Escape Plan, X-Force, Revolution, iPhone App, RIPD, More bit.ly/18eEM8t #SDCC"
What's awesome is that the terrible SyFy movie we're all making fun of still look better than RIPD #SharkNado

"More people will tweet about Sharknado than RIPD. Suck it, Hollywood elites."
You have one movie to watch forever: RIPD or Sharknado. What do you do?
Jeff Bridges accounts for 100% of the reason I want to see RIPD. He looks like he's having so much fun in that role.
Comment I just got sent on a RIPD video. So much incorrect in it. The only thin right is RIPD being based on a comic pic.twitter.com/cgvSZFmuGY
Very low bar. RT @OneFineJay: I’m more excited for RIPD than Pacific Rim.
I've got passes to the KiSS 92.5 premiere of RIPD starring Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges coming up before 11! - @ThatsShem
@Ninjapus RIPD at least looks kinda fun even though it'll probably be dreadful
@Ninjapus RIPD at least looks kinda fun even though it'll probably be dreadful
RT @davejose: Me: RIPD movie looks like the worst movie of all time. @AJBLAG: you are watching #sharknado so you have no credibility.
RIPD looks pretty lame. Too lame to even justify watching it for Ryan Reynolds. *sigh*
Is anyone actually interested in the RIPD movie?
"Is it me or is the ""RIPD"" movie just ""men in black?"""
"I keep reading RIPD as ""ripped."""
I really want RIPD to be fun but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay even matinee prices to find out if it is.
Commercials for Batman & Robin and RIPD during Sharknado. Real recognize real.
"I mocked RIPD, but I'm willfully watching #sharknado."
I still wanna see RIPD & some other dope movie that's coming out August 9th!!!! I forgot what its called but its futuristic AF!!! OuO <3
RIPD looks hilarious.
"wait, Sharknado is just a prequel for RIPD"
RIPD is so bad!
"At least #Sharknado isn't a ripoff of Men in Black. @mosesmosesmoses: RIPD looks good.......compared to #Sharknado."""
lmao yes RT @InSessionFilm: RIPD is a real movie?
So RIPD looks terrible.
RIPD looks good.......compared to #Sharknado.
I want to see RIPD!
I won't be going to see The Wolverine. I do want to see RIPD and RED 2 though...
youtube.com/watch?v=41J6kb… - The prequel to RIPD!! lol!
"Based solely on the trailer, doesn't RIPD seem awfully like a tweaked Men in Black?"
"Yeah, I dunno.. RT @WashingTina: Even though it looks just like Men in Black, I really want to see RIPD."
"After seeing RIPD trailers, be happy they haven't ruined Ghostbusters... yet."
"@kristapley untimely, RIPD"
"Wasn't sure if I wanted to see RIPD but just found out @kevinbacon is in, so I'm gonna have to go."
so RIPD = the plot of Soul Eater
Wow. Kevin Bacon is in RIPD?
"Seems REALLY similar to Men in Black.... ""@erin_linn: RIPD, whoa"""
"This RIPD movie looks so stupid, but I'm sure people are gonna watch it. Studios are giving the green light to any screen play these days..."
These RIPD previews remind me of Dead Like Me. It seems a lot like it.
my homie in da hood said i ripd dat got damn versace beat so damn hard he had 2go2 new york and cop me… instagram.com/p/bt3g8oSxKM/
I imagine the pitch for RIPD went something like this: MEN IN BLACK...with ghosts
That RIPD movie reminds me of MLB..
"So Pacific Rim, RIPD, and now Elysium."
Kinda want to see ripd
Is RIPD the Men In Black 3 script that got rejected?
RIPD looks worse than #Sharknado.
"I can't lie, I'm a little bothered that Jeezy's single didn't make it on the soundtrack of RIPD."
So RIPD is just a different take on MIB. Why did it take me so long to get there!?
youtube.com/watch?v=guYz3H… this looks fun RIPD
fucking incredible. RT @alwayspresh: holy shit this title RIPD pic.twitter.com/xqGQiy7lIN
"I'm betting Red 2 is a monster next weekend, making the Red 2/RIPD showdown an ugly one."
RIPD looks like such a stupid movie
Hard to believe that not a single person at Universal thought that making RIPD was an outrageously bad idea.
Wow! RIPD looks like it's going to be my second favorite Men in Black movie ever!!! #Sharknado
How AWFUL does RIPD look?
RIPD just seems like a SyFy movie idea with a larger budget.
Seems a bit inappropriate to have a previews for RIPD in front of Despicable Me. Not quite a kids movie.
Die RT @rellevent21: You have one movie to watch forever: RIPD or Sharknado. What do you do?
"Me: ""So RIPD is just MIB but with dead people instead of aliens?"" M: ""and 50% more white people."" Me: ""..."" M: ""Will Smith."" Me: ""gotcha."""
"Even while watching Sharknado, I can recognize RIPD as being a terrible, terrible movie."
"On a scale of 1 to ""Turbo"", how stupid is RIPD?"
Better movie: Sharknado or RIPD?
"Every time I see a preview for RIPD, it reminds of Dead Like Me plus some crap I don't care about, like Ryan Reynolds."
"It takes a LOT for a trailer to convince me NOT to see an action movie. Two have accomplished this astounding feat: RIPD, and LONE RANGER."
Makes total sense to see so many RIPD ads during #Sharknado.
"I never really liked that song about ""the ceilings can't hold us"" until that RIPD trailer. It just fits so well. And the movie looks good."
"Still to come in July (US): Turbo, Red 2, RIPD, Wolverine, Smurfs 2. Good year for family product. Personally looking forward to Wolverine"
I can't wait for RIPD - no-one
If you go see RIPD I'm taking you off my friend list. That movie is so bad I asked the movie theater to fast forward during the previews.
"Judging by ESPN promos, Jeff Bridges seems quite comfortable embracing his inner Lebowski. Might even be enough to sell RIPD movie."
This movie RIPD looks absolutely awful. Why is Ryan Reynolds a movie star?
RIPD looks a little...weird. But I'm going to see it because one of my cousin's husband is in it. #JeffBridges #NameDrop
So is RIPD a direct sequel to True Grit? cc: @talkhoops
"Okay, maybe I was wrong. RIPD might end up being my favorite Men in Black movie without Will Smith. #Sharknado"
honolulupulse.com/2013/07/five-0… via @HonoluluPulse a great read as usual from this talented lady a must for all H5-0 fans and RIPD
Just imagine how #Sharknado would be if it had RIPD's budget.
"Our rising star @Greggenheim scores his first Sunday Pulse cover, getting into bed with Marissa Miller of RIPD nypost.com/p/entertainmen…"
"You all can rip RIPD all you want, but I saw a trailer tonight for a Jeff Bridges fantasy movie that looks HAWRIBLE."
What the hell is this movie trailer I just saw? RIPD with Ryan Reynolds (meh) and Jeff Bridges (looking super cool). Never heard of this.
Next movie up is RIPD - looks like a fun summer movie. Enjoyed Superman - The Lone Ranger even more - hope this is as good
So RIPD is just Dead Like Me without Mandy Patinkin or any of the witty dialogue?
Providence has a week to protect itself on July 19. Surely the all of the Rhode Island Police Department will be at opening night of RIPD!
"Wait, is RIPD basically a rip off of Reaper? Except not as delightful as Reaper?"
"Our rising star @Greggenheim scores his first Sunday Pulse cover, discussing pajamas w/ Marissa Miller of RIPD nypost.com/p/entertainmen… …"
"Look, you can't convince me that RIPD isn't Men in Black with dead people. And instead of two Oscar mainstays its one mainstay and a dud."

The Lone Ranger then Pacific Rim then RIPD then The Wolverine. Add 3rd viewing of Man Of Steel and This Is The End. Lotta movies in 1 month
RIPD- that game cannot be installed. I think it's trying to warn me
"YUP, confirmed. RIPD is a reskinned Godmode, good lord"
"Oh great, the developers of God Mode suddenly came out with a RIPD film tiein. Godmode came out 3 months ago. I BET THIS WILL BE GOOD"
THE GOOD GUYS DRESS IN RIPD REMEMBER THAT JUST IN CASE YOU EVER RIPD AND MAKE CONTACT
"Here comes RIPD / Defendin' against dead guys / Uhh / Here comes RIPD / Shootin' at the ghost dudes - Ryan Reynolds' ""RIPD"" song hopefully"
RIPD looks like a good movie
RYAN REYNOLDS IS NICK AS WILL SMITH AS AGENT J IN RIPD AS MEN IN BLACK
"If RIPD is bad, the headlines will write themselves. ""RIPD is DOA"" ""I feel RIPD off"" ""Bridges on Troubled Water"". And so on, and so forth."
"I wasn't going to see RIPD before, but there's a Macklemore song in this trailer."
"Isn't the gimmick in RIPD borrowed from the old Showtime series ""Dead Like Me""?"
"Ryan Reynolds in RIPD trailer: ""Let's do this."" Ryan Reynolds in Turbo trailer: ""Let's do this."""
No joke I predict that RIPD will win every North Korean Film Critics Award
"If your shitty kids want to see RIPD, make them watch Ghostbusters on repeat with their eyelids taped open Clockwork Orange style."
"Anyone else feel like RIPD is just Men in Black...Instead of Aliens, Dead People?"
RIPD looks so awful.
@olv anyone know where the RIPD premiere is?

"Quick shoutout for RIPD this Friday, written by my friends and based on a comic by our very own @plenkov !"
"A Something's Gotta Give remake was inevitable, but RIPD feels too soon."
"Who is pumped up about seeing RIPD?! The words echo across the endless frigid void. I am alone, forever. No one is pumped about RIPD."
I cannot believe how badly RIPD is being dumped. I actually feel bad for the movie.
Wait. Are RIPD and 2 Guns not the same movie?
"Is this the first weekend in history where two actors had two films each? R Reynolds (RIPD and Turbo), Mary Louise Parker (RIPD and Red 2)?"
"Mary Louise Parker fans, you've got a tough decision ahead of ya. She has 2 movies out this weekend: Red 2 & RIPD. Best of luck."
Spoiler: The movie RIPD is about Rhode Island's state police department.
